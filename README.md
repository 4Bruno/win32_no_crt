Minimal Win32 App with no cruntime
Credit to:

For debugging added external code for printf with minimal modification
- https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os 

Caveats:
    - No try/catch handler
    - Many libraries won't work as they need cruntime
    - Stack fixed to 1MB, won't allocate more if needed (I don't need)
    - No array initialization (int a[100] = {};)

Pros:
    - No hidden stuff

Usage:
In project folder do:
cd src
..\build.bat debug
or
..\build.bat release


Implementations:
* Window creation interface
* Input interface

Wanna do:
* Multithread interface

Maaaaaaaybe:
* Linux
